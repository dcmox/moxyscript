<h3>Mission</h3>
<article>
    <p>
        The mission of MoxyScript (and WebDev.ai) is to automate web development in the most natural and seamless way possible using the least amount of dependencies (we love developing things from scratch). It won't happen overnight, but with enough effort and contributions from the open source community, we aim to make it happen!
    </p>
    <p>
        More details will be released as the platform is developed. Feel free to contact the founder on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-moxon/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

    <h4>Principles</h4>
    <p>
        MoxyScript was designed by a developer on his free time with the goals of:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expressing his creativity and ideas freely and openly</li>
            <li>Reducing dependence on external frameworks and tooling</li>
            <li>Creating a project not muddled by corporate or political interests</li>
            <li>Incorporating emerging and growing technologies such as AI and blockchain</li>
            <li>Freedom of choice</li>
            <li>Experimentation and innovation</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Should any of the above goals be broken, this project too will be broken. MoxyScript was created by a developer for developers, <i>not</i> corporate agenda.
